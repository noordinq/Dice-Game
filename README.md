This is a dice game developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
It has a button that shows or hides the rules.
It has six rounds of playing each with 3 dice rolls in each round.
The user is able to get points according to the dice roll options they get and at the end of the sixth round, the totals are added.
Overall a good project that covers concepts such as event handling, array manipulation and updating of the user interface
